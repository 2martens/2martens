$detailedDescription = "<p>Great! You're still here. If you want to get in touch, write me an email ".
"to the email address listed in the sidebar on the right side. I check my mails mostly on a daily basis. ".
"But before you send me job offerings or other things, continue reading to understand a little better ".
"who I am.</p>".
"<p>I have started programming around 2008. After learning HTML (which is not a programming language), ".
"I quickly started learning <strong>PHP</strong> which was my first real programming language. Ever since this time ".
"I continued <strong>programming</strong> mostly on basis of the WoltLab Community Framework which resulted in my first ".
"fully featured web application named 'Ultimate CMS' which is short before the first RC version now.</p>".
"<p>You can see that software development is my passion and even nowadays I spend most of my time ".
"developing software. This <strong>hobby</strong> gives me interesting challenges to solve and opportunities to exchange knowledge ".
"with others to improve the quality of my work even further. As a result of that I learned to love <strong>free ".
"and open source software</strong>, which encourages collaborating to reach a common goal. Therefore I have released ".
"all my software so far under a Free Software license like LGPL. Especially the recent projects are ".
'hosted on <a href="https://github.com/frmwrk123/">GitHub</a>.</p>'.
"<p><strong>Web development</strong> becomes more and more important and I am happy to say that I have experience in this ".
"field for about 5 years now. During this time I had contact to almost all aspects of modern web ".
"applications: frontend and backend (PHP), templates (HTML, <strong>Twig</strong>, Smarty), ".
"client-side scripting (JavaScript including <strong>jQuery</strong>), persistence (MySQL, filesystems) and design (CSS).</p>".
"<p>I love developing <strong>modular software</strong> that allows me to concentrate on the parts I master, while ".
"leaving other parts to those that are better in it. As an example I am no talented at all in design, ".
"so I like software that allows me to concentrate on the business logic and structure and let others do the styles. ".
"And with that I don't mean let others hardcode it but rather let the style be easy exchangable.</p>".
'<p>But I have interests in other areas as well. I am awaiting <a href="http://robertsspaceindustries.com"><strong>Star Citizen</strong></a> '.
"which will be the BestDamnSpaceSimEver (BDSSE), made by the space legend Chris Roberts.</p>".
"<p>Finally I have one proposal for every potential employer: Hire me to work on my own projects. That way ".
"I will be able to concentrate more on these projects, they get finished sooner (up to a certain level) and many ".
"people will profit from it. Above that I will recommend you as a good employer. In these times this is an ".
"endorsement that is not earned easy.</p>";
