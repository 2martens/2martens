2martens
========

The code within this repository manages the frontend of 2martens.de. For the time being it is a minimalistic approach. As time progresses, it will expand into the hub from where you can follow all my activities I am willing to share publicly.

As this is a custom solution for me, it is not licensed under any license. You can look at it to get an example but I won't accept pull requests nor will I endorse forking it.

You can use this as a basic template for your own presentation website. It is programmed in a modular way, which allows you to reuse the logic without the actual content.

It makes use of Twitter Bootstrap.
