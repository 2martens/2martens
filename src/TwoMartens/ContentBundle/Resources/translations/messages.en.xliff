                <target><![CDATA[<p>Great! You're still here. If you want to get in touch, write me an email
to the email address listed in the sidebar on the right side. I check my mails mostly on a daily basis.
But before you send me job offerings or other things, continue reading to understand a little better
who I am.</p>
<p>I have started programming around 2008. After learning HTML (which is not a programming language),
I quickly started learning <strong>PHP</strong> which was my first real programming language. Ever since this time
I continued <strong>programming</strong> mostly on basis of the WoltLab Community Framework which resulted in my first
fully featured web application named 'Ultimate CMS' which was released on March 15, 2014.</p>
<p>You can see that software development is my passion and even nowadays I spend most of my time
developing software. This <strong>hobby</strong> gives me interesting challenges to solve and opportunities to exchange knowledge
with others to improve the quality of my work even further. As a result of that I learned to love <strong>free
and open source software</strong>, which encourages collaborating to reach a common goal. Therefore I have released
all my software so far under a Free Software license like LGPL. Especially the recent projects are
hosted on <a href="https://github.com/frmwrk123/">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Web development</strong> becomes more and more important and I am happy to say that I have experience in this
field for about 5 years now. During this time I had contact to almost all aspects of modern web
applications: frontend and backend (PHP), templates (HTML, <strong>Twig</strong>, Smarty),
client-side scripting (JavaScript including <strong>jQuery</strong>), persistence (MySQL, filesystems) and design (CSS).</p>
<p>I love developing <strong>modular software</strong> that allows me to concentrate on the parts I master, while
leaving other parts to those that are better in it. As an example I am no talented at all in design,
so I like software that allows me to concentrate on the business logic and structure and let others do the styles.
And with that I don't mean let others hardcode it but rather let the style be easy exchangable.</p>
<p>But I have interests in other areas as well. I am awaiting <a href="http://robertsspaceindustries.com"><strong>Star Citizen</strong></a>
which will be the BestDamnSpaceSimEver (BDSSE), made by the space legend Chris Roberts.</p>
<p>Finally I have one proposal for every potential employer: Hire me to work on my own projects. That way
I will be able to concentrate more on these projects, they get finished sooner (up to a certain level) and many
people will profit from it. Above that I will recommend you as a good employer. In these times this is an
endorsement that is not earned easy.</p>]]></target>
