The third party libraries are licensed under their respective licenses and can be used in the way described in these 
licenses.

As the bundle contains absolutely no own code, it has no particular license attached to it. Feel free to use it for 
your own application as you see fit (MIND the licenses of the third party libraries).

The used libraries are specifically Twitter Bootstrap and nothing else at the moment.
